**Hey Product Hunt! 🚀 Introducing Lifelong (Liquid Glass).**

We built Lifelong to solve the complexity of longevity tracking. Most health apps are cluttered and stressful. We wanted something that felt calm, optimistic, and beautiful—like a piece of liquid glass in your hand.

**Why Lifelong?**
Managing supplements, protocols, and family health data is overwhelming. Lifelong brings it all together in a unified, high-fidelity interface.

**Key Features:**
- **Glass-morphic UI:** A stunning, translucent interface that feels native and alive.
- **Protocol Tracking:** Manage your daily longevity routines with ease.
- **Family Insights:** Keep track of your family's health metrics in one place.
- **Privacy First:** Your health data stays yours.

We'd love to hear your feedback on the design and features!
